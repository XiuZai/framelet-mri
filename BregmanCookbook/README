BREGMAN TOOLBOX

Current version: 
1.2 - Deconvolution functions now accept both kernels defined in spatial or Fourier domains.

Previous version:
1.0
 
Date: 05/07/2011

This toolbox provides the source code associated with the Bregman Cookbook available at
http://math.ucla.edu/~jegilles

This software is free and should be used only for nonprofit purposes. Any
unauthorized use of this software for industrial or profit-oriented
activities is expressively prohibited.

Some functions need some extra toolbox:
- Framelet toolbox, written by Jianfeng Cai and available at http://math.ucla.edu/~jegilles
- Curvelab toolbox, freely available for non-profit purposes at http://www.curvelet.org

These toolbox are assumed to be installed properly on your computer (ie the corresponding
Paths are added into Matlab).

This toolbox contains the following files:

-AddCurveletArray.m : sum the curvelet coefficients of two decomposition structures
-AddFrameletArray.m : sum the framelet coefficients of two decomposition structures
-ATV_NB_Deconvolution.m : performs the Nonblind Anisotropic Total Variation Deconvolution
-ATV_ROF.m : performs the Anisotropic Total Variation Denoising
-Curvelet_NB_Deconvolution.m : performs the Nonblind Deconvolution based on Curvelet sparsity
-Framelet_NB_Deconvolution.m : performs the Nonblind Deconvolution based on Framelet sparsity (Analysis approach)
-Framelet_NB_Deconvolution2.m : performs the Nonblind Deconvolution based on Framelet sparsity (Synthesis approach)
-L1_SplitBregmanIteration.m : performs the recovery of a sparse signal affected by a known linear operator
-README : this file!
-ShrinkCurvelet.m : performs the shrinkage of curvelet coefficients
-ShrinkFramelet.m : performs the shrinkage of framelet coefficients
-SubCurveletArray.m : substract the curvelet coefficients of two decomposition structures
-SubFrameletArray.m : substract the framelet coefficients of two decomposition structures
